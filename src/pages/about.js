          <h2>A Little About Me</h2>
          <h5>
            Greetings! I'm Kahu, the mind behind this website, where I showcase my diverse skills so that you will hopefully hire me
            (or just be impressed).
            I'm a 20-year-old Maori, currently in my third year of studying computer science at the University of Canterbury.
            I grew up Wanaka, New Zealand, and I proudly belong to the Ngati Porou iwi. Beyond academics,
            I'm passionate about fitness, sports, surfing, and running, which fill my spare moments with joy.

            I worked full-time at Francesca's Wanaka working roughly 50 hours a week.
